### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data
The data was was acquired from Box Office. The data contains information about types of movies that are watched and the ones that have the highest rating in Box Office. The data has: Data Preparation,Data Cleaning, Future Engineering, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Conclusion and Recommendation. This data contained 49 rows and 14 columns.

## Data Preparation
Before exploratory data analysis could be done, the data was first cleaned and preprocessed. The data was checked for null values and also duplicates. This data had a lot of columns that had similar information, meaning some had to be dropped. Future Engineering was done to combine the two sql tables. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) was done to the data to determine if there was any patterns in the data. This data had a lot of categorical columns, meaning that these columns had to be converted to numeric features in order to be used for graphs. The categorical columns were one hot encoded, and the numeric columns were scaled due to the huge difference in magnitude in the data. This data was then checked the highest rating and plotted graph using the highest raing.


### Conclusion
.The final model is a good illustration of movies watched in Box Office

.Docuentary and adventure genre are the most watched genres in Box Office

.There are different types of movies produced but the one that is mostly seen is The Runways 

.The year 2010 is the year in which most movies were produced


## Recommendation
.With Documentary and Adventure having being the most watched genres it would be a good choice for Microsoft to produce a movie in those genres

.With Box Office having the most movies, once Microsoft have produced their movie they should take it to Box Office to be watched

.The movie that microsoft should produce should be similar to runaways as it is the movie with the most views
